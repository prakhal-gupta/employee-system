# Employee Management System

## Overview

This project is a web-based Employee Management System built with React. It allows for managing employee details, viewing data in an organized manner, and performing various operations like adding, editing, and deleting employee records.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd employee-management-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server. You can view the app by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Any lint errors will also be displayed in the console.

## Building the Application

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder with optimized files for production deployment. The app will be minified, and the filenames will include hashes to ensure better caching.

For deployment instructions, refer to the official documentation on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive mode.

## Ejecting the Application

If you want to customize the build configuration, you can eject the app. **Note:** This is a one-way operation, and once you eject, you cannot undo it.

To eject, run:

```bash
npm run eject
```

This will copy all the configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.

> Ejecting is not necessary for most users. You should consider ejecting only if you need to make deep customizations to the project configuration.
